# Analysis of Jobs in Data 

## Source

Primary source of the data-set is from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hummaamqaasim/jobs-in-data?select=jobs_in_data.csv"> Kaggle </a>. However 
the data was scraped from <a href="https://aijobs.net/salaries/2023/">aijobs.net survey</a>.

## Why Analyze Data-Related Positions

Ironically, not much statistics are widely published on the role of Data-Professional unlike well-established counterparts such as medical and engineering professionals. 
The field is still in it's youth and we have yet to see it stabilize because of the ever-changing nature of the role. 

Here, I attempt to shed some light for like-minded inviduals who are interested in pursuing a career in data. 

## Questions Covered

Here are some major questions I cover throughout the analysis:

<ul>
  <li>Salary Trend from 2020-2023</li>
  <li>Highest paying Data-Related Job Category</li>
  <li>Highest paying countries</li>
  <li>Salary trend over employee experience</li>
  <li>Popular job-titles given to entry-level workers over the years</li>
  <li>Which Entry-level Job Category is the Most Popular in the Market?</li>
  <li>What is the proportion of 'Entry-level' Workers for Each Year?</li>
  <li>Where are the most out-sourced workers come from</li>
  <li>In 2023, which job category hired the most data-professionals?</li>
</ul>
 

## How to View 

Please download the jupyter-notebook. Granted your IDE or Text Editor allows you to view plotly figures, you should be able to view & analyze the results yourself. 
Only issues I ran into was viewing through VS Code through Ubuntu 22.0.
